# Matlab-Extensions

This directory contains matlab scripts that can be used as XTension plugins with image processing software Imaris from BitPlane. To use these extensions for analysis of images, simply copy the '.m' files into your Imaris MATLAB XTensions directory. In Windows, this is usually found under C:\Program Files\Bitplane\Imaris x64 8.4.1\XT\matlab\ .

A detailed explanation of what each script does can be found in the comments at the beginning of each script file. In brief, here is what the following files do:

Filename | function
---------|---------
XTSpotsColocalizeFISH.m | finds colocalized spots from a collection of up to 3 spot objects.
XTSpotsColocalizeFISH4.m | finds colocalized spots from a collection of up to 4 spot objects.
